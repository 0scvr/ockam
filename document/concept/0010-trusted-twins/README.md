# Trusted Twins

Devices, that are intermittently connected, greatly benefit from a cloud based digital twin of the device that is persistently connected so that other entities (devices or applications) can interact with device state and enqueue messages even when a device is offline. Within Ockam we establish mutual trust between a device and its twin using the various techniques discussed above combined with secure enclave technologies like Intel SGX. Low power devices can also leverage Ockam Trusted Twins to amplify their limited resources.
