Rust and Elixir libraries for end-to-end encrypted, mutually authenticated
communication between edge devices and cloud services.

Machines, within the Internet of Things, operate by exchanging messages, with
cloud services and other connected machines. Secure, private, and trustworthy
connected applications must protect these messages from eavesdropping,
tampering, and forgery.

Ockam is a suite of programming libraries and infrastructure that make it
simple for applications to dynamically create end-to-end encrypted, mutually
authenticated, mutually authorized, lightweight secure channels that protect
messages, end-to-end — from their source to their destination.

## Features

* End-to-end encrypted, mutually authenticated secure channels.
* Key Lifecycle and Credential Exchange protocols.
* Attribute based access control with credentials that support Selective Disclosure.
* Add-Ons for a variety of transport protocols, hardware cryptography, and
  enterprise integrations.
* Libraries for multiple languages - Rust, Elixir (more on the roadmap).
