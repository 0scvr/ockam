Ockam is an open source suite of tools, programming libraries and
infrastructure needed for a device to communicate securely, privately and
trustfully with cloud services and other devices.

## Features

* End-to-end encrypted messages.
* Mutually authenticated secure channels.
* Key Lifecycle and Credential Exchange protocols.
* Add-Ons for a variety of transport protocols, hardware cryptography, and enterprise integrations.
* Libraries for multiple languages - C, Rust, Elixir (more on the roadmap).

We believe that Security, Privacy and Trust are application layer concerns and
IoT developers should have easy to use tools to granularly control these aspects
of their applications.

Cryptographic protocols can be a powerful tool to solve many complex, real world
challenges in deploying dependable IoT at scale. Such protocols, however, must
be designed and implemented with extreme care.

In Ockam, we're taking proven cryptographic building blocks and applying them
to build solutions for common IoT and edge computing problems like:

* Secure, easy and rapid __enrollment of large fleets__ of devices.
* Scalable provisioning, proof of possession, rotation, and revocation of __identity keys and credentials__.
* __End-to-end encrypted communication__ over low-bandwidth, intermittently connected, multi-protocol IoT topologies.

Our goal is to provide this functionality with secure, high level application
interfaces that are easy to use correctly and hard to misuse.
